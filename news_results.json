        "story": "I put them head to head  \nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.\n It can be difficult picking which specific iPhone model you want at the best of times. But that becomes even trickier when you're trying to compare models as different as the iPhone Air and iPhone 17. The iPhone 17 has seen a surprising number of upgrades from its predecessor, putting it closer than ever before to the specs of the Pro models. But the entry-level iPhone still costs the same as the iPhone 16 before it, making it exceptional value. On the other hand, there's the iPhone Air. This brand-new type of iPhone drops several features in return for a super-slim frame. Given that it costs $200 more than the iPhone 17, though, its value is harder to calculate. But that's what we're here to help with. We're going to take you through all the key elements of the iPhone 17 and iPhone Air, and hopefully by the end, you'll know which of these phones is right for you. iPhone Air  iPhone 17  Starting price  $999 / £999 / AU$1,799     $799 / £799 / AU$1,399     Display  6.5-inch OLED (2736 x 1260)     6.3-inch OLED (2622 x 1206)     Refresh rate  120Hz adaptive     120Hz adaptive     Rear cameras  48MP main (f/1.6)     48MP main (f/1.6), 48MP ultrawide (f/2.2)     Front cameras  18MP (f/1.9)     18MP (f/1.9)     Chipset  A19 Pro     A19     Storage  256GB, 512GB, 1TB     256GB, 512GB     Battery life  12:02     12:47     Charging  20W wired, 30W wireless (MagSafe)     40W wired, 30W wireless (MagSafe)     Operating system  iOS 26     iOS 26     Water/dust resistance  IP68     IP68     Size  6.15 x 2.9 x 0.22 inches (156.2 x 74.7 x 5.64mm)     5.89 x 2.81 x 0.31 inches (149.6 x 71.5 x 7.95 mm)     Weight  5.82 ounces (165 grams)     6.24 ounces (177 grams)     Colors  Space Black, Cloud White, Light Gold, Sky Blue     Lavender, Sage, Mist Blue, White, Black     The iPhone Air and iPhone 17 launched simultaneously in September 2025, and can be bought from numerous stores and mobile carriers worldwide. The difference emerges when we talk price. As Apple's entry-level flagship the iPhone 17 starts at the usual $799 mark. The iPhone Air begins instead at $999, closer in price to the $1,099 iPhone 17 Pro. But as we'll see by going through the rest of this comparison, that increased price relates mostly to the Air's thin design, as opposed to features that it may have above and beyond the regular iPhone 17. The best iPhone 17 deals can help you get either device for less than their listed prices. Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips. It's actually quite easy to tell these two models apart, whether by sight or by feel. Starting from the back, the iPhone 17 has a dual camera array set in the top left corner in a pill-shaped block. The iPhone Air has but a single camera, which sits in a raised \"plateau\" that spans the top edge of the phone. Fittingly for its name, the iPhone Air is much thinner and lighter than the iPhone 17, measuring 0.22 inches thick and 5.82 ounces in weight compared to 0.31 inches and 6.24 ounces. That's despite the iPhone Air having a larger display, as we'll discuss in a moment.  \n\n\n The other main visual difference is the available color sets for these two phones. Both phones offer versions of black and white, with the Air also coming in gold or light blue, and the iPhone featuring lavender, green and regular blue options. The difference between the iPhone 17 and iPhone Air's display isn't huge, but it is present all the same.  \n\n\n First off, the measurements: The iPhone 17 is a 6.3-inch phone, while the iPhone Air is a slightly more expansive 6.5 inches. Both use Apple's ProMotion adaptive refresh rate tech with a peak of 120Hz, and Ceramic Shield 2, a new screen material that increases durability and reduces glare. iPhone Air  iPhone 17  Peak brightness (nits)  1,678     1,505     sRGB color gamut coverage (%)  111.1     111.3     DCI-P3 color gamut coverage (%)  77.6     80.2     Delta-e color accuracy (lower is better)  0.27     0.2     Our testing results revealed that the iPhone Air is slightly brighter than the iPhone 17, as you can tell from the figures above. But in return, the iPhone 17 does slightly better on color gamut coverage and color accuracy. The iPhone Air has exactly two cameras, and both are the same as what the iPhone 17 has — namely, a 48MP main camera and an 18MP \"Center Stage\" selfie camera. The iPhone 17 also boasts a 48MP ultrawide camera to help fit more into your shots. Neither phone offers a dedicated telephoto lens, instead cropping in on shots captured by the main camera.  \n\n\n Even if the hardware's the same beyond the extra lens on the iPhone 17, there can still be differences in photo performance. That's why we took these two phones out for some real-world camera testing, starting with this shot across a park. There's not much of a difference, but the iPhone 17's image has more intense colors in this instance. I feel the slightly drab-looking iPhone Air image is a more honest take on the scene in real life though. Apple's 48MP main cameras are also capable of lossless 2x zoom shots at 12MP resolution, handy given the lack of a telephoto camera on either phone. The steeple of this church looks a little cooler in the iPhone 17's take on the shot, but detail-wise, there's no difference.  \n\n\n The iPhone 17's ultrawide camera can't be compared to any lens present on the iPhone Air. While you could capture most of this shot with the Air's main camera from where I was standing, the only way to fit in as much would be to walk backward, which isn't always possible or smart. Lacking an ultrawide camera also means there's no macro mode for the iPhone Air to switch to when you need to get close to the action. You can overcome this somewhat with the 2x zoom mode, but when shooting at the same distance as the iPhone 17, this chestnut is a blur to the iPhone Air, while the iPhone 17 produces a nicely detailed image. Lastly, a selfie camera comparison: This is the closest comparison we've had so far, with both phones showing me and the background off in almost identical colors. Interestingly, the iPhone 17 hasn't done as good a job of cutting around my glasses with its bokeh effect, though that could be down to a subtle difference in my head position rather than it being the phone's fault. The iPhone 17 contains a new A19 chipset, but the iPhone Air uses the superior A19 Pro version of that silicon. That said, the A19 Pro inside the Air is missing the extra GPU core and the vapor chamber found in the A19 Pro-powered iPhone 17 Pro models. That might explain some of our benchmark results, particularly when it comes to graphics testing. iPhone Air  iPhone 17  Chipset  A19  A19 Pro  Geekbench 6 score (single-core / multi-core)  3,723 / 9,665     3,701 / 9,460     3DMark Wild Life Extreme Unlimited (score / fps)  3,696 / 22.13     4,899 / 29.3     Adobe Premiere Rush time to transcode (mins:secs)  0:23     0:22     The iPhone Air does score a little higher on the Geekbench 6 CPU benchmark, but it's the iPhone 17 that wins on the 3DMark GPU benchmark and our video transcoding test. We suspect this is due to the iPhone Air's inferior thermals, which may cause throttling. In terms of memory, both phones start with 256GB storage, and can be specced with 512GB storage if the user pays a little extra. The iPhone Air also has a 1TB version on offer. In our battery tests of both of these phones, we were pleasantly surprised by how long they both managed to run. The iPhone Air lasted 12 hours and 2 minutes on our mobile data-based web-browing test, while the iPhone 17 managed 12 hours and 47 minutes — longer, but not significantly so. For charging, the iPhone 17 offers a slightly speedier refuel than the iPhone Air, despite the Air having a smaller battery capacity to fill. Using an official Apple charger, the iPhone 17 reached 71% full after half an hour, while the iPhone Air only reached 55%. These two iPhones, having launched at the same time, come with identical software. Both launched with iOS 26, and should receive an identical number of software updates, likely for the next five or so years. Since both phone feature a variant of Apple's A19 chipset, they also support the same Apple Intelligence features, so you'll get the same AI tools on the iPhone 17 or the iPhone Air. Both of these phones are compatible with a variety of accessories, but the iPhone Air gets a couple of unique ones. One is a bumper case, that protects only the sides of the phone to keep its profile as thin as possible. The other is Apple's new MagSafe battery pack, which doesn't fit on the back of other iPhones due to its shape. If you're concerned about battery life, this could be the ideal accompaniment to your iPhone Air purchase. Normally, the more you pay, the more you get with a smartphone. That’s not the case here, though.  \n\n\n The iPhone 17 is the better-rounded phone of the two we’re looking at here. It has more cameras, a longer battery life, and costs less. But the iPhone Air has a design like no other iPhone yet made, while offering fairly similar performance numbers overall and a larger display. If you're struggling to make up your mind, it's going to be a matter of deciding if a uniquely compact form factor matters more than the features you lose out on — which happen to be features available on every other new iPhone.

        "title": "Apple iPhone 17 Pro Max reviewed: the biggest and best",
        "time": "10/14/2025, 11:58 AM, +0000 UTC",
        "story": "Pickr is an award-winning Australian technology news, reviews, and analysis website built to make technology easier for everyone. Find the latest gadget reviews, news, and more focused on the only ad-free tech site in Australia. At 6.9 inches, the iPhone 17 Pro Max is easily one of the biggest phones around. But armed with an impressive camera and system spec, it may also be one of the best. Phones may well be much bigger than they’ve ever been, but big phones are not created equal. A phone can be large and bring a sizeable screen and equally big battery, but that doesn’t mean you’ll get an amazing handset with solid performance and camera alongside.  Sometimes size doesn’t suggest something especially solid, though it can. In the case of the iPhone Pro Max range, however, Apple has long provided pretty much everything you could want in a big phone, joining the rest of the iPhone range with the biggest and brightest.  Often the best of the best for the brand, the Pro Max model marries the biggest screen to the biggest battery, while still delivering the best chip, camera, and feature set to the handset. It’s no wonder that year after year, the Pro Max is often the best iPhone you can find. In recent years, however, the big Pro Max model and the slightly smaller Pro model have been pretty much identical if not for the screen and battery. The features are so similar, you might struggle to work out what’s different. With this year’s iPhone 17 Pro Max, that continues, as Apple simply offers a bigger excellent pro-level iPhone with more battery life. Is that enough to push the 17 Pro Max into pole position, and can it keep the handset going for years, making it a several year phone purchase, rather than needing an update annually? There’s a new big iPhone every year, but for the past few, the design has largely stayed the same. Three cameras in the top left at the back and a slight wobble when left on a surface has been something of the design for Apple’s Pro Max models, like it has the slightly smaller Pro variation. In 2025, that changes. With the iPhone 17 Pro Max, Apple is keeping the front and the side of the Pro Max the same, but shifting strategy on the back, almost borrowing a page from Google’s Pixel Pro XL models with its camera bar, but expanding the look even more so. That means you get a changed back, and the knowledge that this year you definitely need a new phone case if you want to upgrade to a new phone, though the 17 Pro Max cases also work on last year’s 16 Pro Max phones. The design you get is similar but different, with a shift from titanium last year to aluminium this year, anodised and featuring a colour, which in our iPhone 17 Pro Max review unit was that almost rusty orange Apple introduced. Like the iPhone 17 Pro we reviewed before this, the look is a little different, but very easy on the eyes, with Apple’s typically excellent industrial design at play once again, and a thickness of 8.75mm. It’s a little thicker than last year’s 8.25mm iPhone 16 Pro Max, but not enough for people to notice. We’re not talking a full millimetre here, and the weight of 231 grams isn’t as huge increase on last year’s 227 gram phone, so it’s not as if your pants will notice the change. A little thicker and a little heavier, the new phone sports an updated feature set and processor not unlike its 17 Pro sibling, hardly a surprise given they share so much. About the only change this year is the battery and screen size, both of which are larger in the 17 Pro Max because it’s the “max” model. They both rely on Apple’s latest spot of hardware, the A19 Pro processor running a 6-core CPU and 6-core GPU, complete with a 16-core Neural Engine for AI functionality. You’ll also find an assortment of three cameras on the back in this model, made up of a 48 megapixel F2.2 ultra-wide, 48 megapixel F1.78 wide, and a 48 megapixel 4X telephoto.  That entire stack of cameras is called the “48MP Pro Fusion camera system” because it’s three cameras working together with Apple’s Fusion system, complete with its Photonic Engine and Deep Fusion, a combination of algorithmic and software stacks designed to process images clearly. Support for 4K video is found here, complete with up to 120fps for 4K capture and up to 240fps for slow motion Full HD, though you can also capture 8 megapixel images while capturing video, and record video with spatial audio. There’s also support for ProRAW and ProRes RAW depending on how “pro” you want to go, as well as Log, Academy Colour Encoding, and more. At the front is a new camera, though, the previous 12 megapixel FaceTime HD camera replaced by the 18 megapixel head-tracking Centre Stage selfie camera, offering up an aperture of F1.9 and 4K video, too. Apple also has a new hardware stack for wireless connections, covering 5G, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax/be WiFi 7, Bluetooth 6, GPS, Near-Field Communication (NFC) for Apple Pay, and Ultra Wideband radio for AirTags. Apple’s new N1 wireless networking chip is part of that stack, providing WiFi, Bluetooth, and Thread in the one chip. Oh, and USB-C can be found at the bottom, supporting 10Gbps data over USB 3 and DisplayPort, while also offering wired charging. If you don’t want to use wireless charging, that’s here, too, supported by Qi2 25W and MagSafe. As usual, some of the Apple staples are here, including Face ID security, emergency SOS, crash detection, satellite connectivity, Apple Find My, Thread support, and dual SIM using either two eSIM or a nanoSIM and eSIM collectively. Apple’s iPhone 17 Pro Max is also rated for durability, supporting a rating of IP68 for water and dust resistance, with Apple’s first-gen Ceramic Glass protecting the back of the phone, which is otherwise made from aluminium and glass. The other big feature is the display, which sits atop all of this. One of the largest phone screens around, the iPhone 17 Pro Max provides a 6.9 inch OLED display running the resolution of 2868×1320. That screen is an “always-on” model running between 1 and 120Hz (you’ll see 1Hz when the phone is on standby), complete with Apple’s “dynamic island” sitting in the top centre. The screen itself is bright and clear, offering up to 3000 nits peak brightness outside, but you’ll also find it fairly protected, with a layer of the newly improved Ceramic Glass 2 protecting the screen. The specs might have changed, but nothing about how you use this generation of the iPhone does. As usual, there’s a big bright 6.9 inch touchscreen, support for Apple’s ProMotion technology which stops the screen down to 1Hz to show your wallpaper as an always-on display with notifications, a slightly customisable action button where the mute switch used to be, and a camera controller on the right side as well, last year’s contribution to the iPhone control scheme which isn’t always the preferred way to use the camera. You don’t have to use these extras if you don’t want, and can just push and prod and touch the iPhone 17 Pro Max as you might expect; it’s an iPhone and easy to use. Apple provides home screen customisation aplenty with more control for icon placement, widgets, and even a way to ensure icons don’t have to line up in an annoyingly perfect grid, much like Android has offered for years. It’s probably among the best approach to customisation you can find in phones today, giving users the choice to make their phones the way they want to do it. There’s virtually nothing about using the phone that changes, but the performance increase between the new A19 Pro processor and pretty much anything that came before it is definitely noticeable. A good seven generations of tracking iPhone Pro Max models in our benchmarks shows the increase year on year, and this year’s model has the best performance of the lot. Whether you’re upgrading from an old iPhone or just buying a brand new one, the performance is definitely there, thanks in part to a better processor and more memory, both of which the 17 Pro Max offers compared to its predecessors. Interestingly, though, the performance gains go beyond simply comparing older iPhones. While the story of comparing an Apple phone to an Android is almost a literal example of comparing apples and oranges (thanks in part to how different the operating systems and hardware can be), benchmarks showing this year’s iPhone 17 Pro Max compared against other large flagships paint a picture of Apple in the lead, as well. Synthetic benchmarks don’t always send the right message, mind you; while the iPhone is out ahead in front of every other flagship comparatively in the above benchmark, each one of these performances excellently when used individually, even the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL which seemingly stutters through its graphical benchmark.  However, the comparison is impossible to look past, showing just how strong the iPhone 17 Pro Max is as a mobile, and sending a different message altogether: this phone should keep you going for years to come.  It’s a similar result for 5G performance, which saw speeds as high as 567Mbps in our tests on the Telstra network by way of Belong mobile in Sydney, Australia (before Belong’s speed limiter kicked in). That means anyone with a decent connection should be able to get capable speeds out of 17 Pro Max, with the phone able to deliver high speeds from a 5G internet connection. Nice. The chip isn’t the only increase under the hood, with changes to the camera, as well. You’d notice that clearly from the design change, and that new camera bar, but you’d never really realise it simply eye-balling Apple’s three camera approach over the past few years. However, the specs have changed and the sensors with them, as each camera in Apple’s three-camera array now supports 48 megapixels. That’s 48 megapixels for the 0.5X ultra-wide, 48 megapixels for the 1X wide standard camera, and 48 megapixels for the new 4X telephoto replacing last year’s 12 megapixel 5X camera. This combination allows Apple to do some interesting things. For instance, you can now capture in both 24 and 48 megapixels regardless of the sensor, the Fusion camera system Apple operates now has the same megapixels assortment across the board, increasing quality. Perhaps more interestingly is how Apple now blends the difference between focal lengths in the camera. You see, because a phone lens doesn’t move in and out physically, there’s no actual mechanical zoom happening, so camera makers like Apple have to make up the difference with extra cameras on the phone. But in the 17 Pro Max (and the 17 Pro, too), Apple is using a trick of cropping the sensor to get extra zoom lengths, something Leica also uses in its Q compact cameras that also use a fixed lens instead of something with manual or mechanical zoom. It means that when you capture at 1X on the 48 megapixel wide iPhone camera, you can also crop to 2X at 12 megapixels. And when you capture at 4X on the 48 megapixel telephoto iPhone camera, you can also crop to 8X at 12 megapixels there, as well. This approach gives you a little more range to work with, effectively allowing you to zoom in, even if you lack a zoom lens, so to speak. As a result, the range and versatility of the phone is quite solid, providing great wide angle shots and lovely close photos, as well. In daylight, images are sharp, bright, and clear, while night time doesn’t lose any of that really, either. Apple’s excellent photo processing system delivers consistently solid images, whether you’re capturing a simple photo of family and friends, expanding it with a portrait photo, or getting up close and personal with details and the phone’s telephoto camera or macro lens. Spending more time with the camera also shows you just how capable the image processing system really can be. Macros that offer plenty of clarity when you pay them the time and patience macro photography really deserves, and black and white photography thanks to Apple’s improvements to its “styles” modifier, giving you a little more control over colour, tonality, and in this case, monochrome. We’re still not at the point where the iPhone can really rival a proper camera, let alone a black and white marvel like one of Leica’s dedicated monochrome cameras (a “Monochrom”), but for those of us who can’t afford one of those models, the iPhone’s style mode offers plenty to work with. Not only do you get a versatile and capable camera system that can capture lovely black and whites, but it can also store the original editable file for its eventual return to colour, should you want that, too. Event the front-facing Centre Stage selfie camera setup of an 18 megapixel front-facing camera that can shift its orientation and framing to match your face Apple has developed such a lovely camera system with the iPhone 17 Pro Max. It’s not just a great camera system, but a great battery, too. Tested over several weeks, we found the iPhone 17 Pro Max battery would typically last well over a day of use, often needing a charge into the second day. Your usage will depend on how often you lean on the hardware, with the screen, GPS, and camera eating into the battery life severely based on what you do, and how you use the phone.  For instance, while our battery tests typically delivered to 6 to 8 hours of screen time when using the 17 Pro Max, there were times when it would need a charge even earlier, largely because we were using the GPS more. In regular day-to-day testing, most users will likely want to charge nightly, but the point with this phone is that you may not need to. We found you can totally get by in regular use over two days of intermittent use, with that battery life delivering 7-ish hours of active screen time. Apple’s own testing suggests closer to between 33 and 37 hours if possible with the 17 Pro Max, but our testing couldn’t verify either of those claims, both of which are testing using media from the Apple store. However, our BatteryBench test delivered one of the best results of the year in testing, achieving a runtime of nearly 26 hours, beating the nearly 24 of its iPhone 17 Pro sibling. Sufficed to say, there’s a lot of battery life here, and should you need to top it up, there’s also support for both wired and wireless charging. The price is where things get complex, because the combination of great camera, screen, design, and battery isn’t necessarily going to come cheap, starting in Australia from over the $2K price. Yes, in Australia, the iPhone 17 Pro Max 256GB model is priced from $2199 in Australia and $2549 in New Zealand, making it one of the more expensive phones you can find to date. Granted the starting price isn’t as high as say the nearly-$3K Samsung Galaxy Fold 7 starting price, but over $2K isn’t a cheap price for a phone in either country. That said, while the price is high, the argument for value is complex because this phone is clearly one of the best devices you can find. This year, it is easily one of the best phones, not just one of the best big phones. There’s so much going for the iPhone 17 Pro Max. Its price may stop you, but its feature set and capabilities will keep you going. It’s a stellar device. Outside of price, there’s not a lot that the iPhone 17 Pro Max fails with, if anything. The omission of titanium is a bit of a point, but not one that you’ll probably get angry about. Apple’s design is lovely in aluminium, and the increase in weight is only by a few grams, so you won’t notice it at all. About the only other concern we have is the long-term durability, a factor we’ve noted on the iPhone 17 Pro review. Simply put, Apple’s approach to the colours may be easier to scratch in this generation, making us wonder what our orange 17 Pro Max will look like in a year’s time, or maybe even two, if there’s no case. Most owners will case up (much like Barney Stinson’s “suit up” phrase), and so hopefully won’t have to deal with this. Adding a case also helps balance out the back and prevent wobble, too, so there’s that. Right now, it’s really the omission of titanium that makes the 17 Pro Max feel less premium, sharing aluminium with the lower priced standard iPhone 17. But the niggle of missing titanium isn’t an issue in the grand scheme of things.  The phone feels absolutely and utterly lovely in the hands, and even manages to rest on surfaces better than its predecessors did. The camera bar makes a big difference, and the cases help to keep the whole thing flat. This phone doesn’t wobble, at least not in the most obvious ways other iPhones did. Certainly not in the ways most Android phones have to deal with. Overall, Apple has made what appears to be the perfect big phone, with absolutely no compromises whatsoever. Yes, the iPhone 17 Pro Max is pricey. Every “Pro” iPhone is, and while this is the first time an iPhone has approached the $4000 mark, it’s highly unlikely many will upgrade to the 2TB model costing that much (and if they did, this phone would keep them going for several years, anyway). We’re not going to justify charging that much for a phone, but a 2TB model isn’t going to be the model most people opt for. Indeed, it wasn’t even the model Apple sent; we’re reviewing the 1TB model, and there’s no difference in specs between the variations. What we can say, however, is that while the iPhone 17 Pro Max is on the pricey side, the hardware is easily at the top of its game. Like the smaller iPhone 17 Pro, the 17 Pro Max is the same tech with more battery life, achieving more or less the same value argument, but with a little extra in the tank. And for many, that’s what will count as the main conclusion, delivering the best features with the best battery life an iPhone owner can hope for. There are some catches, of course, and your usage will determine whether or not you even get that full 1.5 day battery life.  Use the phone more, and you’ll likely see less, like we did when we pushed the GPS and camera more on a holiday. Use the phone less, however, and the battery life could be even better. After a few updates, it just might be, anyway.  But right now, the 17 Pro Max is a handset itching to deliver years of life.  If you love a big phone and the best camera around, the iPhone 17 Pro Max has your name on it, delivering the biggest and best in the brightest way.

        "title": "My time with the iPhone 17 Pro's cameras prove it can still battle the best of Android",
        "time": "10/14/2025, 01:03 PM, +0000 UTC",
        "story": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. October 14, 2025 For as long as I can remember, I’ve been telling my friends and family to buy Pixels. I have several reasons for this — customization, updates, and AI features are on the list — but my favorite one has always been to hype up the cameras. See, I’ve just always loved the way Google can pull details and colors out of my stills, not to mention the fact that Magic Editor is, well, magic. The problem, though, is that Google has always been just okay when it comes to videos (sorry, Jonas Brothers). Apple, for its part, has always struggled with the opposite problem — it’s long been the king of video, only to leave me underwhelmed by its photos. Now, though, Apple seems determined to put its stills on par with the best Android camera phones, and I wanted to see if that was really possible. So, I took the iPhone 17 Pro for a busy week around town, and here’s how its camera has shaped up so far. Obviously, there’s something different about the camera on the iPhone 17 Pro. It has blossomed from its corner-mounted camera bump into a full-blown camera plateau, nearly doubling the space that Apple’s three sensors can occupy. Oh, and it did so without adding a silly temperature sensor (looking at you, Google). Anyway, the expansion of the camera bump isn’t purely aesthetic; it actually serves a pretty important purpose. Although the 48MP primary and ultrawide cameras are identical to those on the iPhone 16 Pro, Apple’s upgraded telephoto sensor now has the space it needs to breathe. It’s jumped from a 1/3.06-inch sensor to a 1/2.55-inch design and swapped its 120mm focal length (5x optical zoom) for a more comfortable 100mm equivalent (4x optical zoom), which is much more portrait-friendly. The swap from a 12MP telephoto sensor to a 48MP one also means that the iPhone 17 Pro can take a central crop for 8x optical quality, though without the background separation of a proper 200mm shot. Annoyingly, that means Apple will tell you that the iPhone 17 Pro supports a total of 16x optical magnification, which, I mean, whatever. It’s kind of a made-up number in my book, as I’d hardly count 0.5x zoom from the ultrawide camera as doubling the optical range. That’s not too important, though, I’m just being nitpicky when it comes to Apple’s marketing speak. It’s like declaring that the iPhone 17 Pro has four cameras on the back because its ultrawide sensor supports macro mode — sure, it does, but that’s not an extra camera so much as an additional thing you can do with your existing cameras. Anyway, enough about hardware. Let’s get to some samples. Now, I can at least say that I knew I’d be comfortable with Apple’s cameras going into my time with the iPhone 17 Pro. I knew it had just revamped its camera interface as part of iOS 26, but I knew that many of the buttons and settings menus had remained the same. What I hadn’t anticipated, however, was just how much I’d like the streamlined interface or how impressed I would be by what the iPhone 17 Pro could accomplish. I’ll do my best to maintain some semblance of organization in my samples, but you’ll quickly realize just how much I like Apple’s new telephoto sensor. Up first, the primary sensor (and a quick macro peek). I like the colors Apple has managed across this entire set of samples, with beautiful tones in the sunset over Merriweather Post Pavilion and greenish-blue shades in the Baltimore harbor that seem impossible but were actually spot on. The detail you get from the 48MP sensor is excellent, too, as you can still easily pick out the creases between each piece of the puzzle on the far left side. I like Apple’s macro processing as well, though I wish it had been baked into the telephoto sensor so I could get closer without having to physically move closer, because leaves are so hard to keep still on breezy fall days. I have to admit that I’ve given the iPhone 17 Pro’s 48MP ultrawide sensor the least love during my time with the phone so far. That hasn’t been intentional, but with my week spread across music festivals and soccer matches, I haven’t found much benefit from a wider field of view compared to a tighter one. That said, I did call on it once or twice, mainly to show off the unique structure of the Chrysalis stage to the right and capture just how massive the crowd was to the left. I like both shots, though I probably prefer the scale of the one to the left, as everyone looks normal aside from my seemingly very hairy arm. On the right side, the guy’s head in front of me takes up just a little too much space, but that’s the risk you run at a music festival. Alright, here’s where the iPhone 17 Pro becomes impressive — it’s time for the telephoto lens. Tapping on the small 4x button has become almost second nature over the course of just one week with the iPhone 17 Pro, and I regret nothing. I love how sharp it is while capturing the world’s sleepiest dog, and I love that it gives both the basket of books and the church steeple a clear focal point. No matter the subject, Apple’s colors have been perfect as well. The bright red of the book and the soft yellow of the old Subaru are just as my eye saw them on the sunny day, and Apple didn’t go so far as to wash out the shadows created by the bright sunlight. I’ve also started using 8x zoom, which, as mentioned, is simply a central crop of the telephoto sensor. And, with shots like the four above, can you blame me? I’m used to coming away with terrible concert photos, yet the shot of Griff to the left makes it feel like I was in the front row. The pigeon next to her is just about perfect, too, with natural bokeh — not portrait mode — separating the harbor water exactly as I would have liked. Now, I will admit that I swapped the Photographic Style for the building detail on the far right side, but I’m pretty happy with the sharp black and white contrast as opposed to a sea of muted grays. I won’t lie — I wanted to be disappointed by the iPhone 17 Pro’s cameras. I wanted to reach the end of this gallery and tell you to stick with your Pixel or Galaxy device instead. You can still do that, of course, but it doesn’t feel like the piece of slam-dunk advice I wanted it to be. Instead, I’m facing the fact that Apple might have the most well-rounded camera setup on any smartphone right now. Now, that’s not to say it’s the most powerful camera system — it’s not. You’ll get more megapixels out of the OnePlus 13, the Pixel 10 Pro, and certainly the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, not to mention better zooming capabilities. All of those phones will let you zoom in to 100x magnification (or more), while the iPhone 17 Pro is content to stop at 40x zoom — an upgrade from past years, but a modest one. You’ll also get more clever shooting modes out of a Pixel, no doubt, but that’s not usually why people buy iPhones. No, people buy iPhones because they’re so simple that they’re easy to pick up and use. The simplified camera app allows you to raise your phone, swipe through a few quick options, and capture your shot. If you want to tweak it after the fact, you can switch your Photographic Style, try Clean Up to erase little details, and adjust your crop, but there’s no pressure to do that in the moment. And, unfortunately for Apple’s Android-powered rivals, capturing video is just as easy. I grabbed 4K clip after 4K clip while bouncing along at a music festival, yet the stabilization and clarity would make you think I had a gimbal at my disposal. It’s a level of reliability that I can’t always expect from Google or Samsung, no matter how much I’d rather keep a Pixel in my pocket. Right now, if I had to choose between Google’s mountain of Gemini-powered features and Apple’s top-notch cameras, I’m afraid I might just pick the cameras. Thank you for being part of our community.

        "title": "Apple Responds to Activation Issues of a Large Number of New iPhone 17 Series Devices",
        "time": "10/14/2025, 01:34 PM, +0000 UTC",
        "story": " Image source: Apple's official website Since the evening of October 13th, many users have reported on social platforms that when activating their newly purchased iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro Max, the activation screen shows, \"This iPhone cannot be activated without an internet connection. Please try again, or connect this iPhone to a Mac or PC to activate it.\" Some netizens have tried connecting to Wi-Fi, using a mobile SIM card, or connecting to a hotspot from an old phone, but none of these methods have successfully activated the devices.  Page showing activation failure for iPhone users A user from Beijing said that he bought the phone through a government subsidy program, and according to the regulations, the courier was required to open the package and activate the phone in person. Due to a server malfunction, after trying for an hour with the courier, they still couldn't activate the phone, and finally, the courier had to take the phone back. On October 14th, Jiemian News called Apple's official customer service as a consumer. A customer service representative said that since today, they have received a large number of reports from users about the inability to activate new phones. The official has confirmed this as a widespread malfunction and has urgently reported it to the internal engineering and technical department for handling. However, the customer service representative said that they currently cannot provide a specific timeline for the fix. According to Dongfang Financial News, an Apple Support staff member said that this might be an abnormal issue with the system. If it is indeed a system problem, besides changing the network, a relatively effective solution is to uninstall and reinstall the system on a computer (either a Mac or a Windows computer), after which the phone can be activated and used normally. As of press time, Apple's official website has not issued a public statement regarding the inability to activate the new iPhone 17 series. The Apple iPhone 17 and Pro series phones were released on September 10th and officially went on sale on September 19th, with prices starting from 5,999 yuan/8,999 yuan. At 8 p.m. on September 12th, the pre - sale of the iPhone 17 series officially started. Due to the high enthusiasm of users for the rush purchase, Apple's official website temporarily crashed. According to JD.com data, within 6 hours of opening the reservation, the total number of reservations for the new iPhone 17 series exceeded 2 million. According to Yicai, on the first day of listing, the total number of reservations for the entire iPhone 17 series in the Tmall Apple Store official flagship store increased nearly three - fold compared to the initial launch period of the previous - generation iPhone 16 series. Among them, the white iPhone 17 model had the most reservation numbers. However, before Chinese users received the iPhone 17 series products, Apple admitted that there were camera malfunctions in the iPhone 17 series and the iPhone Air. When directly exposed to extremely bright LED light, black squares and white curves might appear in the photos taken. According to Hongxing Capital Bureau, a journalist participating in the evaluation of the iPhone Air found that when shooting at a concert, about one in every ten photos had small black screens and some white wavy lines. These abnormalities were caused by the strong light interference from the stage LED screen, which led to errors in the camera sensor recording and affected the final imaging effect. Apple said that the above - mentioned problems only occur in extremely rare cases, such as when the LED display is very bright and directly shines on the camera. The company has fixed this problem and plans to release a fix, but it has not yet announced the specific time for pushing the patch. However, the pre - sale of the iPhone Air's Chinese version will start at 9 a.m. on October 17th, and it will be officially available in offline stores on October 22nd. The updated sales information for the iPhone Air on Apple's official website in China shows that in mainland China, China Mobile, China Telecom, and China Unicom can all provide eSIM support for this product. In May this year, Apple also experienced a large - scale service outage that lasted about an hour. Initially, users were unable to log in to their Apple ID and iCloud accounts normally. Later, they couldn't complete payments through Apple Pay, and there were difficulties in checking out on the official website and in retail stores. In addition, some users encountered problems with the iCloud activation lock when trying to activate new devices. This article is from the WeChat public account  \"Jiemian News\".

        "time": "10/14/2025, 12:25 PM, +0000 UTC",
        "story": "The popularity of the iPhone 17 lineup saw Apple almost match Samsung’s market share for the third quarter of the year, according to new IDC data. The firm describes it as “a remarkable achievement,” attributing the ability to sell even more premium phones in a challenging economy to a combination of three factors … CNET reports IDC estimating Apple’s market share in Q3 as 18.2%, almost matching that of Samsung’s 19%. Preorders for the iPhone 17, which launched last month, outpaced last year’s iPhone 16 […] Apple sold 58.6 million iPhones this quarter, an increase of 2.9% over the same period in 2024 […] Samsung still reigns atop the phone market with 61.4 million phones sold, representing 19% of the market in the third quarter of this year — an increase of 6.3% from the same period last year. Meanwhile, Apple lands slightly behind Samsung with 18.2% market share this quarter. IDC says that continuing innovation in both hardware and software are part of the reason for the continued sales success of both premium iPhones and folding phones, but finance schemes like the iPhone Upgrade Program and trade-in deals also play an important role. It’s a remarkable achievement, says IDC senior research director Nabila Popal, citing shrewd financing options as the reason people keep buying these high-end phones, which cost anywhere from $800 to nearly $2,000. “[Phone makers] have mastered the art of innovation not only in hardware and software to entice upgrades but also in removing purchase friction. They have flawlessly combined cutting-edge devices with innovative financing models and aggressive trade-in programs that make the upgrading decision a ‘no-brainer’ for consumers,” Popal said The company says that so far the impact of tariffs doesn’t seem to be biting too hard, though we of course don’t know how strong demand would have been without them.

        "time": "10/14/2025, 02:30 AM, +0000 UTC",
        "story": "Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google. I recently shifted to the iPhone 17 Pro Max from my iPhone 16 Pro, thinking the new 4x telephoto camera and vapor cooling chamber would be the upgrades I notice the most. But after using the new iPhone for weeks now, my favorite pick turned out to be the selfie camera. Odd, right? Also: I've used every iPhone 17 model, and my yearly buying advice is changing in 2025 Many might dismiss the new selfie camera as a minor feature, but the 18MP sensor is more about quality-of-life upgrades than just a megapixel bump. It is housed inside every new iPhone, including the iPhone Air, and offers capabilities that will undoubtedly be copied by the competition -- not because they're trendy but because they're convenient and enhance the overall user experience. As a refresher, the iPhone 17 series comes equipped with a new 18MP Center Stage camera housed in a square sensor. It lets you shoot landscape selfies without needing to turn your phone in that orientation. The software automatically repositions its framing based on the number of people in the photo, and it works surprisingly well!  Apple's Center Stage is one of those rare artificial intelligence features that's reliable and works without you needing to fiddle with the settings. But the best part is that Center Stage works in third-party apps.  Also: Apple's iPhone 17 will forever change how we take selfies - including on Android phones I love it when the feature kicks in on my WhatsApp video calls. I can be moving around doing the chores (I can't sit still), but the camera keeps me in the frame and helps me annoy my girlfriend a little less. I've found Center Stage very useful for Zoom calls on my MacBook Air, and I'm glad it is finally available on my most-used app on iPhone. Center Stage for photos on iPhone 17 Pro Max I have also started shooting more selfies and videos, thanks to auto-framing and ultra-stabilized video features. I like selfies for their more intimate videos and in-the-moment vibes in group shots. However, at times, the moment is lost by the time you turn the phone to landscape orientation. But the iPhone 17 fixes this.  You can enter the camera, turn to selfie mode, and Center Stage for photos will automatically adjust the framing according to the number of people in the group. It is fast, intuitive, and just works. It also keeps you in the moment by finding the best framing automatically. All you need to do is make sure the Auto Zoom and Auto Rotate options are turned on in the viewfinder.  The iPhone 17 also improves selfie video capture with ultra-stabilized videos. This might not look like a big improvement on paper, but it is another upgrade that makes my life easier.  Also: I took the iPhone 17 on a trip to Hawaii, and it surpassed my expectations (until it didn't) I live with a nervous disorder that causes constant tremors in my hands, which often makes my selfie videos shaky -- especially in low light. The result? Awkward, jittery footage that's kept me from recording or posting online. After all, no one wants to watch a trembling vlog from a launch event. But the new iPhones might finally change that. The iPhone 17 Pro is the first phone that actually makes me want to record myself more often. I can shoot smooth, stabilized 4K 60fps video without switching to Action mode or flipping to the rear cameras. The footage is steadier, cleaner in low light, and -- finally -- something I'm proud to share with the world. Whether I'll actually start posting from launch events around the world is another question -- but at least now, my videos can look as smooth and professional as everyone else's, without lugging around an external gimbal. I love this feature more than any other upgrade in the iPhone 17 lineup. And with dual capture, it's genuinely fun to use. The new iPhones let you record yourself and what's in front of you at the same time, using both the front and rear cameras. While several Android phones have offered this before, Apple's unmatched stabilization on both sides gives the iPhone a clear edge in overall quality. Also: I tested the iPhone Air for a week, and here's why 17 Pro Max users shouldn't sleep on it I haven't shot enough photos with the rear cameras yet to judge how much of a leap the new 4x telephoto really is. But from the first day, it was obvious that I'd love to use the front camera. From Center Stage in video calls to auto-framing in photos and ultra-stabilized clips, the 18MP selfie camera is easily the star of the show on my iPhone 17 Pro. And I'm glad Apple didn't reserve it for the Pro models -- you get the same experience on the more affordable iPhone 17 and the ultra-slim iPhone Air."

        "story": "\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.\n It’s as polished an experience as an iPhone has ever been, and the new telephoto camera makes distance photography more achievable than ever. With high-end video features, this is an iPhone to suit the serious content creator, and casual users probably don’t need all this heft. But if an iPhone is your daily driver for photos and video, and you don’t like the bulk of the Pro Max, the 17 Pro is the best you can get. \nWhy you can trust Creative Bloq\n\n\n\n\nOur expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.\n The coming of September heralds three inevitable things: summer comes to an end, the kids go back to school (suckers), and Apple brings out a new batch of iPhones. This year, it’s the iPhone 17 series, and I’ve been out testing the iPhone 17 Pro. It’s been a long time since a proper iPhone wheel reinvention, and the 17 Pro is not that. It’s an iterative update, adding a beefed-up telephoto camera and the improved A19 chipset for, supposedly, faster-than-ever performance. Look, it’s the new iPhone. If you’re reading this, you likely know what you’re in for. I’ve used plenty of iPhones before in a professional capacity for reviews, group tests and buying guides, though in my personal life I’m a committed Android user, having owned a selection of Samsung Galaxies and, for my sins, Fairphones. Whenever a new iPhone arrives, I’m always curious to see whether this will be the one that’ll tempt me to fully make the switch (I recently kicked in a Windows desktop PC for an M4 Mac Mini, so I’m nothing if not persuadable). Will the iPhone 17 Pro be the one? I spent a few days with it to find out.  \n\n\n Chipset: A19 Pro Memory:  12GB OS:  iOS 26 Screen: 6.3-inch Super Retina XDR OLED Resolution:  2622 x 1206 Refresh rate: Up to 120 Hz Storage:  256GB, 512GB, 1TB Rear cameras:  48MP Fusion camera, 48MP Fusion Ultrawide, 48MP Fusion Telephoto (enables 12MP 8x Telephoto mode) Front camera:  18MP Center Stage camera Connectivity:  Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, USB-C 3.2 Battery: 4,252mAh Dimensions:  150 x 71.9 x 8.75mm Weight: 204g I’ve long felt that the Pro iPhones are perfectly sized – the Pro Max models I find to be too big for my hands and pockets – and at 150mm length and 204g weight, the iPhone 17 Pro feels just right. The protruding camera module draws attention to itself, but that’s pretty much a given for smartphone cameras these days, and is the price we pay for all those sophisticated camera modes we refuse to do without.  \n\n\n The body, newly constructed from aluminium rather than titanium, feels lightweight and strong. The screen is protected by Apple’s scratch-resistant Ceramic Shield 2, and in a first for the series, there’s now also Ceramic Shield protection on the rear of the handset too. I wasn’t allowed to take a corkscrew to the loaner to test this, but I did accidentally leave it in a bag with my keys several times, and it came away scratch-free. It’s IP68 weatherproof rated, which means it should survive a hosing, but not a submerging. The screen is of course a delight; it’s the same 6.3-inch Super Retina XDR we saw in the iPhone 16 Pro. Once again you’ve got those rounded corners that take off a bit of effective real estate, meaning it’s a 6.27-inch screen in real effective terms, but I frankly don’t want to meet the person who’s bothered by that. It’s buttery-smooth for gaming, TV watching, reading, whatever you like to do. Once again, we have assignable buttons on either side, including the action button that can be assigned to various functions, such as the torch or an AI-powered translation service. Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors.  \n\n\n On the other side is the camera control button, which I love as a physical shutter button, but find a bit underbaked otherwise. Maybe it’s because I use so many proper cameras in my day-to-day, but I don’t find holding it down to activate video to be intuitive at all. The half-press to open zoom modes and double half-press to open camera modes is still as fiddly as it was on the iPhone 16 Pro, and resulted in many accidental photo captures on my part. And once the menus do open, I don’t find them particularly well-placed or easy to use at the top of the screen (I guess I’m supposed to use my thumb? Don’t care for that).  \n\n\n Ultimately, the button just doesn’t really do what it’s clearly trying to do – make the camera experience more immersive and fluid. Love the idea, but I hope Apple takes another swing at it. As mentioned, we have a new A19 chipset, upgraded from the A18 Pro on the iPhone 16 Pro, and it delivers the kind of solid, incremental improvements you’d expect. Take a look at the benchmark scores below. CPU single-core:  3,691 CPU multi-core: 9,325 GPU Metal: 45,701 The CPU scores are solid, with the multi-core score of 9,325 showing nearly a 15% increase over the performance of the iPhone 16 Pro (Apple generally promises improvements of around 10-20% every time, so this is right in line). The single-core performance score shows a slightly less impressive 11% bump over the iPhone 16 Pro, at 3,691, but hey, a bump is a bump. The Metal GPU test gave a beefy score of 45,701, which is a healthy 38% increase over the iPhone 16 Pro, and is nipping at the heels of the iPad Air M3. If you want a phone specifically for gaming, the iPhone 17 Pro is going to be a demonstrably better experience than any other iPhone save the 17 Pro Max. Battery life is very good. I spent an evening playing Civilization VI (‘Yes, of course it’s for work, stop asking that.’) after a day of photography, video and benchmark testing, and it was well past my bedtime when the phone finally died. Apple claims it’ll last up to 33 hours of video playback, and from my anecdotal experience, I believe it. The A19 pro chipset is supposed to be Apple’s best in-phone architecture yet for powering AI, as tech companies are all legally obligated to claim with their new releases. With that said, Apple has been a little more circumspect than some other companies with regard to its own AI infrastructure, preferring to let others do the heavy lifting. Case in point – you can integrate Apple Intelligence with ChatGPT if so desired, and you don’t even need your own ChatGPT account. I took it for a spin with the Visual Intelligence feature, which lets you point the camera at your environment and ask questions about it. The results: patchy, with some kinks that need ironing out and some problems that are just baked in. For instance, I theoretically liked the way I could point it at various plants and have ChatGPT tell me what kind of plant they were. But, it has the problem that all such generative AI functions have – it’s just guessing based on its dataset, and I have no way of knowing if it’s actually correct, so every answer comes with a big honking disclaimer that it might not be accurate and I shouldn’t use it for anything important. Truly the future is a magical place.  \n\n\n The system doesn’t have a standard recourse when it doesn’t know an answer. It repeatedly failed to identify an image of the extremely obscure and very rarely photographed political figure Nelson Mandela, but rather than giving me an ‘I don’t know’, it kept just re-asking ‘What do you want to know?’, occasionally spicing things up with a ‘Something went wrong’. I also tried out the Apple Intelligence Live Translation feature, which supposedly makes it possible to fluidly communicate across language barriers. When confined to text, it’s brilliant, allowing you to quickly translate screenshots and messages from one language to another (even if it’s not always perfect, you’ll definitely get the gist). I tried the voice-translation feature, going from French to English and back, and… it sort of works if you speak very slowly and don’t use any unusual words that sound like common ones. The idea that it could facilitate a fluid, real-time conversation between two people speaking different languages – well, I’m sceptical, to put it mildly. The big new feature is that the telephoto camera has been upgraded, going from 12MP to a 48MP Fusion module, the same resolution as the Main and Ultrawide. In practice, this means you have a lot more zoom power, with a high-quality 4x zoom mode, a 12MP 8x zoom mode, and even the option to go up to a digital 16x zoom, an equivalent focal length of 200mm (on a real camera, that would be a whacking long lens). The zoom modes hold up really well when viewed on a monitor. I’m generally not a fan of digital zoom, but honestly the 16x isn’t bad! There’s clearly a bit of interpolation helping things along, but while the resulting image is grainy, it’s still usable. The camera array also does well in low light – I took the phone to a concert, and found that the 4x zoom gave me the best balance between quality and closeness to the subject (though the 8x was no slouch). The close-up and macro mode uses the ultra-wide camera to give you a shallow depth of field. I’m not a fan of the auto-activation feature – supposedly it kicks in smoothly when you move your camera close to a subject, but in practice I found it kept turning itself on and off while I was trying to adjust my composition, and soon I lost patience and locked it on.  \n\n\n Video has also received a hefty upgrade, aimed squarely at the pro market. The iPhone 17 Pro boasts features like: the ProRes RAW video codec; the Log2 flat colour profile for maximising dynamic range, thereby preserving detail for the color grade; and genlock for synchronising multiple video devices. Ninety-five per cent of people who use the phone won’t know what those things are, and don’t need to know, but if you’re someone who uses an iPhone for professional video content creation, I’d say the iPhone 17 Pro seriously merits consideration as an upgrade. There’s a lot here. The iPhone 17 Pro starts at $1,099 / £1,099 for the 256GB model, rising to $1,299 / £1,299 for the 512GB model, and topping out at $1,499 / £1,499 for the 1TB model. You can further increase this price with the Pro Max model if you’d like to. So, did the iPhone 17 Pro do enough to tempt this hoary old Android user? Well, I’m not sure if I want to spend that much on a phone right now, but I really enjoyed my time with it, and will be loath to give it up. Casual users get more than they need to pay for, particularly in terms of pro video features, but the iPhone 17 Pro features camera upgrades and performance enhancements that will have content creators and gamers swooning. Ultimately, the Android/iPhone dynamic is the same as it ever was. If you hone in on a specific feature, you’ll almost always find an Android phone that’ll do it better (the Xiaomi phones with 1-inch sensors are better for photography, the Infinix phones are better for gaming, etc). But, the iPhone 17 Pro provides a smoother and more polished all-around package than any single Android phone, and given how many tasks we give our phones these days, there’s a lot to be said for that. out of 10 It’s as polished an experience as an iPhone has ever been, and the new telephoto camera makes distance photography more achievable than ever. With high-end video features, this is an iPhone to suit the serious content creator, and casual users probably don’t need all this heft. But if an iPhone is your daily driver for photos and video, and you don’t like the bulk of the Pro Max, the 17 Pro is the best you can get.

        "title": "iPhone 17 vs iPhone 17 Pro vs iPhone 17 Pro Max: The Real Differences Explained",
        "time": "10/14/2025, 11:52 AM, +0000 UTC",
        "story": "When Apple unveils a new iPhone line-up, choosing the right model can feel like navigating a maze of specs and features. From display size to camera performance, we’re breaking down exactly what sets each iPhone 17 apart, so you can make an informed choice and find the perfect fit.  If you’re trading in an old device to make some extra cash for your iPhone 17 of choice, our ‘sell my iPhone’ service is ideal. Tracked, secure shipping, guaranteed quotes, and exceptional reviews are just a few highlights of selling with Mazuma.   The screen size you go for will all depend on how you use your phone. If you like having your apps and widgets on the larger side, or use your phone regularly for streaming or gaming, the Pro Max is the biggest option. Coming in at 6.9” (the same as the 16 Pro Max), it’s got plenty of room to see your family and friends on FaceTime, catch up on your favourite YouTube videos, and more. The base 17 model is still an upgrade from the iPhone 16 at 6.3”, in comparison to 6.1”.   The main difference between the Pro and Pro Max is the price and screen size, so if this isn’t a factor for you, you’d still be getting many of the same features with the Pro model.    Image Credit: Apple It’s becoming increasingly popular to upgrade your phone to access the latest camera capabilities, and the 17 is no exception.   Every model comes equipped with a powerful 48MP Fusion Main camera and a 48MP Fusion Ultra Wide lens, ensuring stunning clarity and detail across your shots. The Pro and Pro Max models go a step further, featuring an additional 48MP Fusion Telephoto camera with new focal length options that keep images sharp even when zoomed in.  The base 17 has 0.5x-2x optical zoom options, but the Pro and Pro Max can zoom up to 8x, a significant improvement from the 5x seen in the 16 Pro Max.   Nosebleed seats at a concert? You could still be looking at crisp quality photos with the 8x zoom.   If you use your phone for everyday photography, the 17 is perfectly capable. If you’re looking for something a little extra, or are into content creation, it might be worth looking at either the Pro or Pro Max.  Image Credit: Apple Another reason users tend to upgrade, is due to the battery. After years of usage, iPhone batteries become tired and unreliable, making a new device even more appealing. Here’s what to expect with Apple’s latest releases:  From the iPhone 16, this is a staggering upgrade, with the base 16 model offering up to 22hrs video playback. If you’re noticing a poor battery, why not ‘sell my iPhone 13’ or ‘sell my iPhone 14’?  This year, Apple have adjusted their pricing strategy. Rather than having a Plus model, they’ve introduced the iPhone Air, making the jump from the base 17 to the Pro seem bigger than before. Since the Pro Max is only £100 more than the Pro, they’ve also made it more tempting to spend that bit more for the bigger screen and enhanced battery.   These are just starting prices, and depend on which extras or storage option you go for. If the prices seem high, don’t worry – selling with Mazuma means you can put cash towards your new device.  Colours aren’t always the priority when choosing a new phone, but it’s worth noting the difference between the different models. For instance, there are fewer options for the Pro and Pro Max, so if having a pastel purple or green phone is something you’re interested in, the base 17 is the way to go.   Image Credit: Apple We all know that feeling of taking out your phone to take a picture, when you’re hit with the ‘out of storage’ pop-up. With any of the 17 phones, you’ll be set for storage, as the minimum storage capacity is 256GB. Here’s a breakdown:  To get an accurate idea of how much storage you’ll need, simply look at what your current phone has, and whether you find yourself running out of storage or paying for additional iCloud space. If you’re upgrading from an older iPhone, you’ll find that the storage offered on these phones is a significant improvement.   When it comes down to it, all three models have something to offer:  Upgrade today and sell your iPhone with Mazuma. Get an instant quote, free tracked postage, and same-day payment once we receive your phone. Simple, secure, and hassle-free.  "

        "title": "Ahead of iPhone 17, Apple’s iPhone delivered its best Q3 results ever",
        "time": "10/14/2025, 03:39 PM, +0000 UTC",
        "story": "Update font size. Reset Apple’s iPhone achieved record-breaking shipment results in a July quarter. Additionally, demand for the new iPhone 17 series proved exceptionally strong, with pre-orders exceeding those of the prior generation. According to preliminary data from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, global smartphone shipments increased 2.6% year-over-year (YoY) to 322.7 million units in the third quarter of 2025 (3Q25). The smartphone market continued its recovery, fueled by the premium segment as consumers upgraded to the latest devices, attracted by innovative form factors and more affordable AI-enabled smartphones. “The smartphone industry continues its upward trajectory, posting solid growth — a remarkable achievement given persistent economic uncertainty and tumultuous tariff dynamics,” said Nabila Popal, senior research director for Worldwide Client Devices, IDC, in a statement. “OEMs have mastered the art of innovation not only in hardware and software to entice upgrades but also in removing purchase friction. They have flawlessly combined cutting-edge devices with innovative financing models and aggressive trade-in programs that make the upgrading decision a “no brainer” for consumers.” “Despite economic uncertainty, the smartphone market showed resilience. Apple and Samsung posted strong results as their latest devices encouraged consumers to upgrade in the premium segment, while new, affordable AI-enabled smartphones also drove high upgrades in more affordable price categories,” said Francisco Jeronimo, vice president, Client Devices, IDC, in a statement. “Apple delivered its best results ever in a July quarter, while Samsung achieved its strongest July-quarter growth on record. Demand for Apple’s new iPhone 17 lineup was robust, with pre-orders surpassing those of the previous generation. At the same time, Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7 outperformed all earlier foldable models, creating renewed momentum for the foldables segment.” Beyond the top two vendors, Xiaomi, Transsion, and vivo also recorded notable growth during the quarter. Xiaomi consolidated its recovery in Europe and Latin America, leveraging its Redmi Note and Poco series. Transsion continued to expand rapidly across North and East Africa, benefiting from strong distribution networks and a competitive portfolio in the sub-$200 segment. Vivo regained share in several emerging markets, supported by refreshed midrange devices with AI-enhanced imaging features and aggressive online promotions. “Looking ahead, IDC maintains a positive outlook for 2025, anticipating that market momentum will continue through the final quarter of the year,” said Anthony Scarsella, research director for Mobile Phones at IDC, in a statement. “The accelerated demand for the latest AI-enabled products is expected to lead to a strong finish for 2025, driven by aggressive pricing promotions and robust product portfolios from leading vendors.”  Notes:\n● Data are preliminary and subject to change.\n● Company shipments are branded device shipments and exclude OEM sales for all vendors.\n● The “Company” represents the current parent company (or holding company) for all brands owned and operated as a subsidiary.\n● Figures represent new shipments only and exclude refurbished units.\n● IDC declares a statistical tie in the Smartphone market when there is a difference of one-tenth of one percent (0.1%) or less in the shipment shares among two or more companies. MacDailyNews Take: Based on gross margins (Apple at 45%, Android average 10-15% based on vendor reports like Samsung’s ~10% smartphone margin), Apple accounts for 75-80% of the smartphone industry’s gross profits. Operating profit share is similar or higher (80-85%), as Apple’s efficiencies amplify the gap between real and pretend iPhones. ‎\nPlease help support MacDailyNews — and enjoy subscriber-only articles, comments, chat, and more — by subscribing to our Substack: macdailynews.substack.com.

        "story": "According to Apple, iPhone Air pre-orders on the mainland start at 9am on Friday, while shipments begin next Wednesday According to Apple’s China website, iPhone Air pre-orders would start at 9am on Friday, while shipments would begin next Wednesday – about a month later than the rest of the world, owing to regulatory restrictions regarding eSIM technology on smartphones. Prices for the iPhone Air start at 7,999 yuan (US$1,122). Regulatory support for eSIM on smartphones marks a milestone for China’s smartphone industry, as the technology replaces physical subscriber identity module cards to enable manufacturers to design thinner handsets and provide a secure means of authenticating devices on mobile networks."

        "title": "Apple Execs Explain How iPhone 17 Center Stage Camera is Reinventing the Selfie Experience",
        "time": "10/14/2025, 05:10 PM, +0000 UTC",
        "story": "Apple has long set the standard for smartphone photography. With the iPhone 17, the company takes a bold step forward by overhauling the front-facing camera. Dubbed the Center Stage camera, this upgrade isn’t just about sharper images—it’s a thoughtful redesign that prioritizes how we naturally hold and use our phones. Jon McCormack, Apple’s Vice President of Camera and Photo Software Engineering, describes the iPhone as a “really social camera,” with the front lens playing a starring role in our daily connections. In an exclusive interview with BW Businessworld, McCormack and iPhone product manager Megan Nash revealed how the team rebuilt the selfie system from first principles—starting with hardware realities and evolving into intuitive user behaviors. The new sensor marks a significant leap: a square 24MP design, nearly twice the size of the previous 12MP rectangular one. This larger footprint allows for better light capture, reducing noise in low-light conditions and delivering crisper details. But it’s the integration of software smarts that truly elevates the experience. McCormack emphasizes on a holistic approach,“It fundamentally changes the way that we capture our memories and communicate with our loved ones,” he shared, highlighting how finger positioning and screen interactions influenced the design. Nash complements this by bridging hardware and humanity. During the iPhone 17 launch, she demoed how the square sensor enables wider fields of view without distortion—ideal for vlogs or virtual meetings. Their collaboration underscores Apple’s commitment: innovation that feels invisible yet indispensable. What do you think—will this redefine your selfie game?
